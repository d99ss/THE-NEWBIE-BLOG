            <h1>Overloaded with adorable canals and bridges,<br> Amsterdam brings the charm</h1><br>
            <q>From its picturesque canals and bridges to its historic homes, Amsterdam is a full-blown fairytale. The
                brightly-colored bicycles and tulip stands around town don’t hurt either.</q>

            <p>Amsterdam is a <b>strange city</b>, but strange things are not strange at all because they are rooted
                from the
                most civilized ideas. A city in which you should not be surprised to see a warning: “You will be not
                arrested for using drugs in Amsterdam.</p>
            <p>Call 112 for medical assistance”, which means you will not be
                considered guilty if you use drugs. Or another special thing is that there is a separate neighborhood
                for prostitution, yes it is a government-approved job to operate normally like any other profession. It
                is a civilized country with a high sense of every citizen.</p>
            <p>So, is Amsterdam worth visiting? Let’s discover one of the most beautiful destinations in Europe through
                our Amsterdam travel blog (Amsterdam blog) with the fullest Amsterdam travel guide blog (Amsterdam city
                guide, Amsterdam visitors guide) for a wonderful trip to Amsterdam on a budget for the first time from
                how to get there, where to stay, best places to visit and what to do… in Amsterdam below to find out the
                answer!</p>
            <p>Coming here you will see why people call Amsterdam is the city of <em>bicycles</em>. When you can clearly
                see the
                two main means of transportation of people are bicycles and cars. You will even see a lot of bicycles
                moving from early morning to late night, a lot more than cars.</p>
            <p> And you also have never see such many
                types of bicycles. From the bikes we have known since childhood, to the bikes with cargo trailers
                attached to the back and front, for carrying kids.</p>
            <p>Again the children in Amsterdam, there are 4, 5-year-old children who have their own bicycles and their
                parents ride bikes together. <u>I have caught a few small children</u> that cycling very quickly,
                extremely
                brave though the road is quite crowded.</p>
